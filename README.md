# Covid - 19 exploratory analysis

### What does it do?

It's a sequence of queries that reads and manipulates a csv file into insightful tables to later be visualized in a Tableau dashboard.

### What were the tools used?

- Microsoft SQL server Studio
- Tableau public

### Why have I made it?

With the new Omicron variant and vaccinations recently being made available in Brazil I got curious about new developments concerning covid.

### Take a look at it as a Tableau viz on my profile
